This is a template project for a full stack application with a focus on automated processes to help many key processes that should be involved in any project. All of these processes have competitors in their space that could be used instead, but before removing components ensure that an alternative is first created.

In particular this template tries to cover:

Hooks (Husky)
Code Styling (Prettier)
Linting (Checkstyle, ESLint)
Build Automation (Maven, Docker)
Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)
Testing (JUnit, Cypress, Jest)
Coverage (Jacoco. Jest)
Documentation (JavaDocs)
Containerization (Docker)
Security Scanning (Dependabot, Snyk)
Monitoring (Grafana, Loki)
Logging
Backup
